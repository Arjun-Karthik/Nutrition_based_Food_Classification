# NutriClass: Food Classification Using Nutritional Data

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
1. Data Understanding
   
   - Loaded a tabular dataset containing food nutrition information.
   - Inspected:
     - Class distribution
     - Sample entries
     - Dataset size and balance
     - Noise and inconsistencies

2. Data Preprocessing
   
     - Handled missing values through imputation or row removal.
     - Removed duplicates to prevent skewed learning.
     - Detected and treated outliers in features like calories or sugar.
     - Normalized/standardized numerical features to ensure model stability.

3. Feature Engineering

     - Applied Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding for categorical targets.
     - Explored PCA / feature selection techniques to reduce dimensionality.
     - Finalized a cleaned, well-prepared dataset for training.

4. Model Selection & Training
   
     - Trained and compared multiple models:
        - Logistic Regression
        - Decision Tree
        - Random Forest
        - K-Nearest Neighbors
        - Support Vector Machine
        - XGBoost
        - Gradient Boosting Classifier
     - Used cross-validation to ensure robustness.
  
5. Evaluation & Insights
   
      - Evaluated models based on:
        - Accuracy
        - Precision
        - Recall
        - F1-score
        - Confusion Matrix
      - Also compared:
        - Model performances side-by-side
        - Feature importance and contribution
        - Visualization of prediction behaviors
